			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Environment and Authentication",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the environment setup task into subtasks for repository creation, dependency installation, and API authentication verification.",
			"reasoning": "This is a standard environment setup task with clear steps. The complexity is relatively low as it involves familiar operations like creating repositories, installing packages, and setting up authentication. The task is well-defined with specific steps already outlined."

			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Configuration Management",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the configuration management task into subtasks for AI developer configuration, state management implementation, and validation functionality.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating structured configuration files and implementing functions to manage them. The complexity is moderate as it requires careful handling of state persistence and validation. The JSON structures are already defined, reducing ambiguity."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop GitHub Data Extraction Scripts",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the GitHub data extraction task into subtasks for repository listing, PR extraction, commit extraction, incremental processing, and error handling/rate limiting.",
			"reasoning": "This task has significant complexity due to the need to handle pagination, rate limiting, cross-platform compatibility, and incremental extraction. It involves working with multiple GitHub API endpoints and processing potentially large datasets. The error handling and platform compatibility requirements add additional complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Linear API Integration",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the Linear API integration task into subtasks for API client implementation, ticket data extraction, PR-ticket matching algorithm, and caching/error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves complex pattern matching to identify ticket IDs in PR content and creating a reliable matching algorithm. The caching mechanism and handling edge cases like multiple ticket references increase complexity. Integration with an external API adds uncertainty."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Develop AI Analysis Engine with Claude Integration",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the AI analysis engine task into subtasks for Claude API client implementation, prompt engineering for different analysis types, context preparation, batch processing optimization, and caching/error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This is a highly complex task as it involves sophisticated prompt engineering for multiple analysis dimensions and optimizing LLM interactions. The need to truncate diffs while preserving context adds complexity. This is the core intelligence of the system and requires careful design to ensure accurate and consistent results."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement AI Attribution Detection",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the AI attribution detection task into subtasks for pattern detection implementation, override configuration integration, confidence scoring, and usage rate calculation.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires developing heuristics to identify AI-assisted work through various patterns, which involves uncertainty and edge cases. The confidence scoring mechanism adds complexity. The task combines pattern recognition with configuration-based overrides, requiring careful integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Data Unification and Processing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the data unification pipeline task into subtasks for data loading and deduplication, Linear ticket integration, impact score calculation, incremental processing, and validation/error handling.",
			"reasoning": "This task integrates multiple data sources with complex relationships and requires sophisticated deduplication logic. The impact score calculation and process compliance tracking add analytical complexity. This is a central component that ties together many other parts of the system, increasing its complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Developer Metrics Aggregation",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the developer metrics aggregation task into subtasks for data grouping by author/week, frequency metrics calculation, quality metrics calculation, and trend analysis implementation.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves statistical analysis and time-based aggregation of developer data. The complexity comes from ensuring accurate calculations across different time periods and handling edge cases like developers with no activity. The trend analysis adds analytical complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Output Generation and State Management",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the output generation task into subtasks for CSV file generation, incremental update support, and state file management.",
			"reasoning": "This task focuses on file I/O operations and state persistence. The complexity is moderate, mainly coming from the need to support incremental updates and ensure data integrity. The task is well-defined with clear output formats."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Develop GitHub Actions PR Analysis Bot",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide the GitHub Actions PR analysis bot task into subtasks for workflow configuration, analysis engine adaptation, comment formatting/posting, and label application.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves creating a GitHub Actions workflow that integrates with the analysis engine and interacts with PRs in real-time. The complexity comes from handling GitHub's event system, managing API interactions, and ensuring proper comment updates rather than duplications. Testing this component requires simulating PR events."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Create Main Execution Script and Scheduling",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the main execution script task into subtasks for command-line interface implementation, pipeline orchestration, scheduling setup, and error recovery/logging.",
			"reasoning": "This task orchestrates the entire system and needs to handle different execution modes and error recovery. The complexity comes from coordinating all components and ensuring robust operation under various conditions. The scheduling requirements add additional complexity."
