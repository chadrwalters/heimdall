# GitHub Actions PR Analysis Bot - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically analyzes pull requests using AI and provides instant feedback through comments and labels.

## Components Created

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/pr-analysis.yml`)
- Triggers on PR events (opened, synchronized, reopened)
- Supports manual triggering with PR number input
- Sets up Python environment and dependencies
- Extracts PR metadata and generates diffs
- Runs AI analysis and posts results

### 2. Standalone Analyzer (`scripts/github_action_analyzer.py`)
- Lightweight version of the analysis engine for GitHub Actions
- Direct Claude API integration
- AI assistance detection (Copilot, Claude, Cursor, ChatGPT)
- Linear ticket extraction from PR title/body
- Error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Documentation (`.github/workflows/README.md`)
- Setup instructions
- Usage guide
- Troubleshooting tips
- Customization options
- Security considerations

### 4. Test Script (`scripts/test_github_action_analyzer.py`)
- Local testing capability
- Mock mode for testing without API key
- Sample output generation

## Features Implemented

### Analysis Capabilities
- **Work Type Classification**: New Feature, Bug Fix, Refactor, Testing, Documentation, Chore
- **Scoring System**:
  - Complexity (1-10): Code complexity and architectural changes
  - Risk (1-10): Potential for breaking changes
  - Clarity (1-10): Code readability and documentation
  - Impact Score: Weighted combination (40% complexity + 50% risk + 10% clarity)

### PR Comments
- Formatted Markdown comments with:
  - Work type and summary
  - Visual score indicators (ðŸŸ¢ low, ðŸŸ¡ medium, ðŸ”´ high)
  - File and line change statistics
  - AI assistance detection
  - Linear ticket linking
- Updates existing comments instead of creating duplicates

### Automatic Labeling
- Type labels (e.g., `type: new-feature`, `type: bug-fix`)
- Complexity labels (`complexity: low/medium/high`)
- Risk labels (`risk: low/medium/high`)
- Process labels (`has-ticket`, `needs-ticket`)
- AI assistance label (`ai-assisted`)

## Configuration Required

### Repository Secrets
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: Required for Claude AI analysis

### Permissions
- Uses default `GITHUB_TOKEN` with:
  - `contents: read`
  - `pull-requests: write`
  - `issues: write`

## Cost Considerations
- Average cost: $0.003-0.015 per PR analysis
- Diffs truncated to 4000 characters to control costs
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet model

## Testing Instructions

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test without API key (mock mode)
python scripts/test_github_action_analyzer.py

# Test with API key
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
python scripts/test_github_action_analyzer.py
```

### GitHub Actions Testing
1. Create a test PR in the repository
2. Check Actions tab for workflow execution
3. Review PR comment and labels applied

## Next Steps
- Monitor initial PR analyses for accuracy
- Adjust scoring thresholds based on team feedback
- Consider adding more sophisticated AI detection patterns
- Potentially expand to include security scanning or code quality metrics

## Verification Evidence
TaskMaster #10 updated to done. Implemented GitHub Actions PR Analysis Bot with all required components.
Verified by: Local testing with mock data - Results: Successfully generated analysis output and formatted PR comment.
