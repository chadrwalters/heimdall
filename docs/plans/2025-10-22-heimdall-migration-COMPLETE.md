**Agents Ported**: 4 specialized agents
**Justfile Commands Added**: 15+ new commands
**Documentation Files**: 5+ created/updated
**Lines of Code**: ~2000+ lines of infrastructure

## .claude Infrastructure

### Commands (8 total)
- `/gt:commit` - Smart GT commit workflow
- `/gt:restack` - Safe GT restack operations
- `/test:debug` - Interactive test debugging
- `/ci:analyze-failure` - CI failure debugging
- `/linear:enhance` - AI-powered ticket enhancement
- `/cleanup-docs-justfile` - Documentation cleanup
- `/create-command` - Command generation meta-tool
- `/ground-truth` - Documentation verification

### Agents (4 total)
- `git-commit-expert` - GT commit workflow specialist
- `gt-restack-expert` - GT restack operations specialist
- `graphite-expert` - General GT operations
- `pr-review-expert` - PR review request generation

## Team Benefits

1. **Graphite Workflow**: Full GT support with AI assistance
2. **PR Quality**: AI-enhanced review requests via huginn
3. **Debugging**: Systematic CI and test debugging
4. **Linear Integration**: Enhanced ticket management
5. **Consistency**: Justfile-first for all operations
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and verification

## Technical Details

### Justfile Namespaces Added
- `env`: Environment management (install-huginn, setup, check)
- `git`: Git utilities (status, branch, commits, info, diff)
- `gh`: GitHub utilities (actions, actions-latest, actions-watch, branch-sync)
- `pr`: Pull request operations (request-review, enhance, last-review)
- `docs`: Documentation tools (validate-justfile, validate-links, list)
- `linear`: Linear integration (test, cycles, env)

### CI/CD Updates
- All jobs use justfile commands
- `just quality lint` - Linting
- `just quality format-check` - Format checking
- `just test coverage` - Testing with coverage
- `just quality type-check` - Type checking
- `just quality security` - Security scanning
